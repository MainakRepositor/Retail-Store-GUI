# Retail-Store-GUI
A GUI based retail store application.

### Idea:
This application is used to reduce paper work and organization labour, that is needed to run and maintain a grocery shop. The GUI used is better than the conventional Python GUIs and is quite attractive for an end user. The application comprises of an Admin account and some employee accounts, a real-time database of commodities and orders and a smart inventory management system with alerts.
